   My name is Michael Morel. My love for tech and software has lead me to teach myself HTML and CSS. This website is a result of my passion and dedication. I specialize in Java but have experience with many other languages and software. I am highly excited for the opportunity to work with a team and plan to learn as much as possible from Louisiana State University and my employer.
