      "Roar Coffee House's raspberry mocha latte is on another level from anything else I have experienced. Complex bitterness from the 2 shots of espresso was in no way overpowering, the mocha comes through with noticeable raspberry notes as well. The art was stellar, a swan design precisely made. 11/10",

    description:
      "Roar Coffee House allows you to choose the color of the background and an optional rainbow design on top. This background is called a 'charcoal base,' which makes the rainbow on top pop even more. It's art is great, but the taste is slightly chalky as a result, and my mouth was stained black. Overall, I'd rate this drink 9/10.",
