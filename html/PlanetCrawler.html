  <span id="BGB">Planet Crawler is a game made in Unity3D C# solo by Michael Morel. The objective of the game is to claim as many planets as possible. This is done by having a higher Attack Power (top left number) than the <span style="color:rgb(20, 123, 192);">Planet Power</span> of the planet you are attacking. A taken over planet will turn dark and will produce Attack Power for you as an income.</span>

  <span id="BGB">When a planet is clicked you can see it's <span style="color:rgb(179, 176, 45);">Population</span>/<span style="color:rgb(59, 155, 40);">Current Season</span>/<span style="color:rgb(20, 123, 192);">Planet Power</span>. When your Attack Power exceeds the selected <span style="color:rgb(20, 123, 192);">Planets' Power</span> an <span style="color:rgb(247, 41, 41);">Attack Button</span> will appear. When Attacked, A planet is claimed by the player and the <span style="color:rgb(20, 123, 192);">Planets' Power</span> is subtracted from your Attacking Power, however this difference is made up quickly.</span>

  <span id="BGB">Everything in this game is randomly made with every instance of the game. This means that each planet is completely unique in every reload of the game, this includes the planets position in space, color, size, <span style="color:rgb(179, 176, 45);">Population</span>, <span style="color:rgb(59, 155, 40);">Current Season</span>, and <span style="color:rgb(20, 123, 192);">Power</span>. This game was made to show a skill I have that would be valuable to a team. I decided to show off my skills at random, unique, and intriguing gameplay.</span>

    <span id="BGB">The game has a randomness that makes every instance of the game different. If this concept was fully implimented it could give a game a massive amount of replayability.</span>
