    <span id="BGB">The Mosquito is an application made in C# by Michael Morel, Haytham Bachar, Henry Reynaud, Angel Tran, Ross Browning, and Hudson Kirkpatrick. This application was created to curve procrastination. The user will input the applications that will distract them if they are doing work. This is usually things like youtube and videogames. After deciding which apps will distract you, the next step is to enter the Task Viewer</span>

    <span id="BGB">The above picture is from the Application Manager. This section is what handles the apps that are distracting. Every .exe file on your computer is put in alphabetical order then given a number and displayed. From this list you may pick a number associated with the app you find distracts you often. This app is displayed and saved to a file that will keep track of these apps for when the prevention system is running.</span>

    <span id="BGB">This section of The Mosquito is for entering the tasks that you need to get done once the preventer is running. In this section you may enter tasks with the <span style="color:rgb(22, 160, 206);">Create</span> button then delete them from the ones you have listed with the <span style="color:rgb(22, 160, 206);">Delete</span> button. These tasks will presist after the program has stopped running, as all of the task information is stored in a file. Entered tasks will appear in the bottom section and this part will automatically update. Michael Morel was responcable for the creation of the backend of this section</span>

    <span id="BGB">The Productive section of the program will wait for the user to tell when a task is finished. The program will be continuously checking the apps currently running to make sure that an app that is listed as distracting is not running. If one is running then the preventor will be triggered. This will lead to the user getting pop-ups telling them to get back to work. If the user refuses to close the distracting app after this, mini games will pop up for the user to complete. These games include a guessing game where the user must click the correct button out of 25 identical buttons and a game asking the user to click on the correct pictures out of a group.</span>

      <span id="BGB">The <span style="color:rgb(22, 160, 206);">Completed</span> button will take out the task from the list and give the user "<span style="color:rgb(22, 160, 206);">Reward Time</span>". Every completed task rewards 5 minutes of time. This time can be redeemed for time off of the preventor. This incentivises the client to get work done, them use the time accumulated to do as they please. The <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0);">STOP</span> button will return back to the Task Viewer,</span>
