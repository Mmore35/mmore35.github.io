  <span id="BGB">School Day is a game made in Unity3D C# by Michael Morel and five other team mates. The game is an artistic representation of going through High School. You will be tasked with defeating school subjects represented by mobs. Once a room is cleared the player can leave to take on the next room.</span>

  <span id="BGB">The picture shows the first class room. One of the strongest aspects of School Day are the creative and interactive weapons the player can use. The weapon will be displayed at the bottom left, health in the top left and class in the top middle. Once all of the classes are passed the player will graduate.</span>

    <span id="BGB">I created the interactive HUD that displays instructions to the user aswell as the current Classroom/Weapon/Health. All of these systems are highly optimpized but also feel highly interactive and frequently change. I am also responsible for various functions that are called frequently, including colorized health regeneration functions and item name identification.</span>
