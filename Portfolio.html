    <span id="BGB">This project was made to create an AVL Tree then run different pieces of code to observe this tree. The code that is pictured was made only by me and finds the height of this tree. This code is not on my GitHub, as my professor does not want this full code avalable to the public. My professor gave me the skeleton of this project and I worked on this project in Febuary of 2020 over the course of a few weeks without the help of anyone else and has not been changed since then. My AVL Tree Project was made in Eclipse IDE and this picture was taken in the VS Code IDE.</span>
