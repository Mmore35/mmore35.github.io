    <span id="BGB">This project was made to create an AVL Tree then run different pieces of code to observe this tree. The code that is pictured was made only by me and finds the height of this tree. This code is not on my GitHub, as my professor does not want this full code avalable to the public. My professor gave me the skeleton of this project and I worked on this project in Febuary of 2020 over the course of a few weeks without the help of anyone else and has not been changed since then. My AVL Tree Project was made in Eclipse IDE and this picture was taken in the VS Code IDE.</span>

    <span id="BGB">This project taught me about the heap data structure, we made Heaps with some help from our professor and then created code with no help that would do different operations to this heap. The code that is pictured was made only by me. This code has different methods to analize the heap that was made on another file. This code is not on my GitHub, as my professor does not want this full code avalable to the public. My professor gave me the skeleton of this project, which I finished in December of 2019 over the course of a few weeks without the help of anyone else and has not been changed since then. This project was made in Eclipse IDE and this picture was taken in the VS Code IDE.</span>

      <span id="BGB">This picture is from my heap source code. It shows my peek() function which returns the root of the heap and the rebuild() function which transforms the data back to a heap after being modified. Also shown are various other minor funcions.</span>
