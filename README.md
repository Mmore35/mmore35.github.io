## About the Tech

#### Tailwind CSS

"Tailwind CSS is an open-source CSS framework. Unlike other CSS frameworks like Bootstrap, it does not provide a series of predefined classes for elements such as buttons or tables."

Tailwind allows for styles to be applied with less code, inside the same file as the JSX/TSX, resulting in reduced development time.

#### Vite

"Vite is a local development server used by default by Vue and React project templates. It supports TypeScript and JSX, using Rollup and esbuild internally for bundling."

Vite is lightning fast, starting a local server in fractions of a second. Local changes in code are reflected on the server nearly instantly, eliminating waiting times for server restarts.

#### Yarn

"Yarn is one of the main JavaScript package managers, developed in 2016 by Meta (formerly Facebook) for the Node.js JavaScript runtime environment."

Yarn differs from npm by caching downloaded packages, making installs faster when frequently updating dependencies.

#### TypeScript

"TypeScript is a free and open-source high-level programming language developed by Microsoft. It adds static typing with optional type annotations to JavaScript, designed for the development of large applications, and transpiles to JavaScript."

TypeScript adds types to JavaScript, reducing the frequency of errors, catching errors before compilation, and providing more accurate IntelliSense.

#### Framer Motion

"Framer Motion is a simple yet powerful motion library for React. It's associated with Framer, the web builder for creative pros, offering zero code, maximum speed."

While not utilizing Framer software directly, Framer Motion allows for animated components in JavaScript with relatively simple code.
